# Gradio Mini-Projects

This repository contains all the projects built using Gradio.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Text Summarization
The Text Summarization project allows users to input a block of text and receive a concise summary generated by a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
The Named Entity Recognition project allows users to input text and identify entities such as names, dates, and locations within the text using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Gradio
- Transformers (Hugging Face)

### Usage

#### Text Summarization

1. Run the Text Summarization app:
   ```bash
   python TextSummarizationApp.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:7860` to interact with the app.

#### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

1. Run the Named Entity Recognition app:
   ```bash
   python NamedEntityRecognition.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:XXXX` to interact with the app.

## About
These mini-projects were my first experience with Gradio, and they provided a great introduction to building interactive machine learning applications. The total time taken to build both projects was approximately 2 hours.
